        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-white">About Me</h2>
        <p className="text-white">Racing motocross has been my passion since I was 4 years old. In 2010, I began chasing my dream of professional racing, earning my pro license in 2013. I stepped away in 2015 to pursue cycling including mountain, road and gravel racing. Now based in Durango, the itch is back, and I am ready to continue the motocross racing dream.</p>
